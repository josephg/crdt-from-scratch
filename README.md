# FugueMax from scratch

I made a youtube video where I programmed up FugueMax (a text CRDT algorithm) live in front of the camera!

[Watch the video of me programming this up live on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lQ2Q4Kzi1I)

This is the codebase after all the programming is done, including all the commits.

Thanks for following along! Enjoy!
